# Finance-AI-Automation-Comparative-Intelligence-Platform

This project automates financial and document analysis by standardizing and comparing multiple financial statements and PDFs.
It identifies low-rated or inconsistent data, suggests improved structures, extracts relationships and sequences using embeddings, and enables question answering across multiple uploaded documents using a RAG-based architecture.
The system supports comparative analysis, validation, and insight generation, and is designed to handle messy real-world data rather than clean academic datasets.
